-  Interactive K-Map Grid
-  Calculation of MinTerms
-  Supported upto 5 variables
-  Simplification of Boolean Expressions

## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have installed all necessary dependencies for your platform. For detailed instructions, refer to the Raylib documentation.

2. **Update System Environment Variables**:

   Add the following path to your system environment variables:
   ```bash
   C:\raylib\w64devkit\bin

3. **Navigate to Source Directory**:

   Open a terminal and navigate to the following path:
   ```bash
   C:\raylib\raylib\src

4. **Compile Raylib**:

   In the terminal, run the following command:
   ```bash
   mingw32-make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP

5. **Locate Compiled Library**:

   After the command executes successfully, a new file named ```libraylib.a``` will be created.

6. **Replace Existing Library**:

   Copy the newly created libraylib.a file and replace the existing ```libraylib.a``` file in the lib folder within your project directory.

7. **Create Makefile**:

   Create a Makefile in your project directory and add the following content:
   ```bash
   # Define the source files for the project
   SOURCES = ./src/fourvar.cpp ./src/grid.cpp ./src/kmapsolver.cpp ./src/main.cpp ./src/threevar.cpp ./src/twovar.cpp

   # Default target to compile the project
   default:
    # Compile the source files into an executable named game.exe
    g++ $(SOURCES) -o ./build/game.exe -g -O1 -Wall -Wno-missing-braces -I include/ -L lib/ -lraylib -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm
    
    # Run the compiled executable
    ./build/game.exe


8. **Run the Program**:

   To compile and run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   make
   
## Usage
Click on the cells in the K-Map Grid to flip between 0 and 1. After configuring your K-Map, click the "Calculate" button to compute the minterms. The "Visualize" option allows you to see the K-Map Expression using logic gates.
